# Live Meeting Helper Community Code of Conduct

## Introduction

Live Meeting Helper is an open-source project focused on making meetings more accessible and productive through real-time transcription and AI assistance. We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for everyone. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all participants to ensure respectful, inclusive, and collaborative interactions. Harassment, discrimination, or toxic behavior will not be tolerated in our community.

## Our Values and Expectations

**Respect and Inclusivity**: Always treat other community members with respect and kindness. We welcome diverse perspectives and backgrounds. Discrimination or derogatory comments are not acceptable. Everyone should feel included and valued, regardless of experience level, nationality, gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, or any other attribute.

**Collaboration and Shared Growth**: Our community thrives when we learn from each other. Be collaborative—help others who ask for guidance, and be open to receiving help or feedback. We believe in shared growth, where mentorship and constructive feedback allow all members to improve together.

**Innovation and Experimentation**: We encourage you to explore creative ideas and solutions in real-time audio processing, speech recognition, and AI integration. Experimentation is welcome—even if an idea fails, it contributes to our learning. We value open idea exchange and constructive disagreement, as long as it is done with mutual respect. Critique ideas without attacking people.

**Learning from Failure**: Mistakes and unsuccessful experiments are natural steps toward success. Do not ridicule or blame those who hit roadblocks or whose experiments don't work out. Instead, support them and discuss what can be learned. We foster an environment where taking risks and learning from setbacks is encouraged and celebrated.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable in the Live Meeting Helper community:

**Harassment or Discrimination**: Any form of harassment, hate speech, or discrimination is prohibited. This includes offensive comments or slurs related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, or any other personal characteristic. Such behavior will not be tolerated.

**Personal Attacks or Insults**: Do not insult, demean, or belittle other contributors. Avoid ad hominem attacks. Focus critiques on ideas and code, not on people.

**Trolling and Disruption**: Sustained trolling, intimidation, excessive arguing, or other behaviors that disrupt a constructive conversation are not allowed. Our community should remain a place of civil and productive dialogue.

**Unwelcome Sexual Attention**: Sexualized language or imagery, unwelcome sexual advances, or any inappropriate sexual attention is unacceptable in any community context.

**Doxxing and Privacy Violations**: Sharing someone else's private or personal information (such as physical or email addresses) without explicit permission is strictly prohibited.

**Other Toxic Behavior**: Any other behavior that is inappropriate for a professional, open-source community environment is also unacceptable.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces and communications of the Live Meeting Helper project. This includes the project's repositories, issue trackers, discussion forums, chat channels, social media, and in-person or virtual events. It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public (for example, at conferences or on social media).

## Reporting Violations

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, or have any concerns, please report it as soon as possible. You can contact Peter W. Szabo at <peter@kaizen-ux.com>, who is the point of contact for any Code of Conduct issues. Please provide as much detail as you can, including links or screenshots if appropriate. All reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality.

## Enforcement

Community leaders and maintainers are responsible for enforcing this Code of Conduct. They will review all reported incidents and determine an appropriate response. Consequences for violations may include a warning, removal of problematic content, or in serious cases, temporary or permanent exclusion from the community. We are committed to fair and consistent enforcement of these standards.

By working together to uphold this Code of Conduct, we can ensure that Live Meeting Helper remains a welcoming place for everyone to collaborate and innovate. Thank you for being a part of our community and for upholding these values.
